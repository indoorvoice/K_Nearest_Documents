# K_Nearest_Documents
Project for Machine Learning.

Reads .mmtx file formats and then runs a K-nearest neighbours classifier to determine the predicted label.
Reads both a .mmtx data file and a .mmtx labels file.

Project was intended to build a machine learning classifier from scratch, using no libraries. As such, only base Python is used.

Project is structured as a module of functions and a short interactive script which allows the required functionality to be displayed.

Functionality specified to be included was:
  An unweighted KNN classifier.
  Weighted KNN classification.
  Cross validation. This project implements leave-one-out cross validation.
